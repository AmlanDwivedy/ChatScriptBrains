ChatScriptBrains
================

Repository of brains to be placed in chat script.   Give back license, you use these brains, give back some more brains. :)


The file structure mimics the layout needed by the ChatScript server.  The exception is the aiml2cs directory - this directory contains a perl script to help translating aiml -> chatscript.  That process is nessisarily a partitially manual process - as a lot of the macros require human interpretation of what behavior was intended in order to translate it to the chatscript methods of doing similar things.
