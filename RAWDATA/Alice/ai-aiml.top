#! what is a girl like you doing TEST
u: (what is a girl like you doing *)  Well, actually, when I chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldnt have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! im just a construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. Is the merest hint of femininity in my acronym a.l.i.c.e. really enough to arouse your lust?  You must be male!  
#! what is a chatterbox
u: (what is a chatterbox)  A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think. 
#! what is AIML
u: (what is AIML) The ALICE software implements AIML Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card * in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the <aiml> and </aiml> tags respectively.
#! what is the Loebner prize
u: (what is the Loebner prize)  The Loebner Prize is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won it in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked most human computer by the panel of judges. 
#! what is the imitation game
u: (what is the imitation game) The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading chat-handles like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman or shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man. In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game? Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, Can machines think?

u: (is ai about *)  Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  
#! is ai a bad TEST
u: (is ai a bad *)    The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible.
