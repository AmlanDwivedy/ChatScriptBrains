<category><pattern>WHAT IS PROGRAM BAWT</pattern>
<template><br/>Significant demand for a version of ALICE compatible with<br/>pre- Java 2 (formerly known as Java 1.2) prompted the<br/>development of "Bawt.java", an open source java program<br/>for chat robot development that works with older versions of<br/>Java, and AWT. Originally program B relied on <br/>Java 2 and Swing, but program Bawt needs only Java 1.1 and AWT.<br/>Swing is a newer GUI package that subsumes the earlier Java <br/>Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT).<br/> <br/>At present class B merely extends class Bawt. Swing not<br/>supported.<br/> <br/></template>
