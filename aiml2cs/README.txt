project to translate AIML to ChatScript.  The target aiml is the Alice basic set and the goal is to get it at least 90% there so that that set can be hand edited into a working Alice for ChatScript.  I realize aiml and cs have some 'impedence mismatch' that will have to be manualy migrated.  I just want a head start on all the typing... :)
