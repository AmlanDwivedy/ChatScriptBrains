project to translate AIML to ChatScript.  The target aiml is the Alice basic set ( found at http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/sets.html ) and the goal is to get it at least 90% there so that that set can be hand edited into a working Alice for ChatScript.  I realize aiml and cs have some 'impedence mismatch' that will have to be manualy migrated. My plan is to place any AIML fragments I can't understand in comments in the output chatscript file for hand editing.  I just want a head start on all the typing... :)
